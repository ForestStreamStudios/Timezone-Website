# Timezone Website
## TODO
- Change the colors in `time-zone-map-app/src/data/timezone_colors.json` to be a better set of 5, they are now repeating stripes.
- Add a UI with like headers and stuff.

## Setup Instructions
Open a terminal in `time-zone-map-app` and run `npm install`. It's ok if it takes some time. Run `npm start` to open a dev server once that's done.

## Important Files
- `data/timezone_count.json` is where we actually specify how many in each timezone
